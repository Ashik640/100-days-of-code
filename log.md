# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Planned everything for the next 100 days. Reinstalled jdk and android studio. Started watching videos.

**Thoughts:** I wanted to learn this from a long time. But, never started seriously. I will mainly follow 'The Complete Android Oreo Developer Course' [Udemy Course] for this. [https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-android-oreo-developer-course/]

**Link to work:** Not available.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
